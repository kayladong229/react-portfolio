# react-portfolio

Completed homework for the Module 20 challenge. The purpose was to create a new portfolio using React.js demonstrating some of the projects I worked on over the course of this bootcamp. The porfolio has four sections, a header, and a footer. Users can click the tabs on the header to switch between the About, Portfolio, Contact and Resume sections. The footer has icons that are respectively linked to my Github, LinkedIn, and Stack Overflow accounts.
